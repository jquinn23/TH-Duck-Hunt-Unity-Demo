# TH-Duck-Hunt-Unity-Demo
I created this game as a private learning project with Unity. One of my friends used to make a funny duck noise when we would play games, and I asked him to record it for me one day. I pulled it out of the mothballs (along with a picture) to make this small duck hunt demo in order to learn the ropes with Unity
